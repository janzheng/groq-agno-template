# Groq + Agno AI Agent Template

[Agno](agno.com) is a lightweight framework for building multi-modal Agents. Its easy to use, extremely fast and supports multi-modal inputs and outputs.

With Groq & Agno, you can build:

- Agentic RAG: Agents that can search different knowledge stores for RAG or dynamic few-shot learning.
- Image Agents: Agents that can understand images and make tool calls accordingly.
- Reasoning Agents: Agents that can reason using a reasoning model, then generate a result using another model.
- Structured Outputs: Agents that can generate pydantic objects adhering to a schema.



Build intelligent AI agents with Groq's lightning-fast inference and Agno's powerful agent framework. This template demonstrates both simple chat agents and complex multi-tool agents with real-time data processing.

## Customization
This template is designed to be a foundation for you to get started with. Key areas for customization:

### Model Configuration
```python
# Change the default model in stocks.py
DEFAULT_MODEL_ID = "qwen/qwen3-32b"  # or "llama-3.1-8b-instant"
```

### Agent Instructions
Modify the agent instructions in `stocks.py` to customize behavior:
- Analysis format and style
- Tool usage patterns
- Response formatting
- Context handling

### Tool Integration
Add new tools to expand agent capabilities:
```python
from agno.tools.web import WebTools
from agno.tools.email import EmailTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Groq(id="llama-3.1-8b-instant"),
    tools=[
        YFinanceTools(...),
        WebTools(),
        EmailTools()
    ]
)
```

### Visualization Options
The template supports multiple visualization libraries:
- **Rich**: Terminal tables and markdown rendering
- **Plotext**: Terminal-based charts and graphs
- **Matplotlib**: High-quality PNG chart exports
- **MDV**: Enhanced markdown rendering

## Web Search Integration

### Groq's Compound-Beta Model
This template features cutting-edge web search capabilities powered by Groq's **compound-beta** model - an experimental model that can search the web in real-time and return comprehensive results with source attribution.

**Key Web Search Features:**
- üåê **Real-time Information**: Get the latest news, developments, and insights
- üîó **Source Attribution**: All results include clickable source URLs
- üì° **Raw Output**: Direct access to compound-beta's unprocessed search results
- üéØ **Adaptive Focus**: Automatically adjusts search strategy based on your query
- ‚ö° **Lightning Fast**: Powered by Groq's ultra-fast inference infrastructure

**Example Web Searches:**
```bash
# AI and Technology Developments
"what's zuckerberg doing with ai recently?"
"latest developments in nvidia's ai chips"
"recent partnerships between tech companies"

# Business Strategy and Innovations
"tesla's latest product announcements"
"microsoft's recent ai acquisitions"
"google's new ai research initiatives"

# Market and Industry Analysis
"recent changes in ai industry landscape"
"latest regulatory developments in tech"
"emerging trends in artificial intelligence"
```

**How It Works:**
1. **Direct Query Processing**: Your question goes directly to compound-beta
2. **Real-time Web Search**: The model searches current web sources
3. **Source Compilation**: Results include URLs, dates, and attribution
4. **Raw Output Display**: See exactly what compound-beta found

**Integration with Stock Analysis:**
- All stock analyses now include web-enhanced insights
- Market sentiment analysis incorporates latest web intelligence
- Company analysis includes recent news and developments
- Comparison reports feature current market context

## Advanced Features

### Conversation Context
The advanced agent maintains conversation history and can reference previous analyses:
```python
chat_context = {
    "conversation_history": [],
    "analyzed_stocks": {},
    "session_start": datetime.now(),
    "total_queries": 0
}
```

### Multi-Agent Architecture
The stocks example uses specialized agents:
- **Reasoning Agent**: Comprehensive stock analysis
- **Web Search Agent**: Real-time information gathering with compound-beta
- **NLP Agent**: Natural language command parsing
- **Chat Agent**: Conversational responses with context

### Real-Time Data Integration
All financial data comes from live sources:
- Current stock prices and volumes
- Analyst recommendations and price targets
- Company news and earnings data
- Historical performance metrics
- **Web search results** from compound-beta for latest developments
- **Source-attributed information** with clickable links and publication dates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing API Key**
